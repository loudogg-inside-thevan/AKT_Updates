# AKT_Updates

AKT stands for Analyst Key Takeaways. I am a mutual fund analyst who on a quarterly basis scores my company's coverage universe of funds on 6 metrics: Risk-Return Profile, Tenure, Volatility Profile, Fees (relative to mutual fund peers), Performance (relative to mutual fund peers), Equity Correlation, and Fixed Income Correlation. The responses are standardized and quantitatively defined, thus I built this project to automate a part of the process for producing the quarterly metric responses for input into our database.
